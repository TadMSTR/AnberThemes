# AnberThemes
Theme installer for [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos)  
Tested on the RG351P  
Still needs work but functions for the most part

Adapted [AnberPorts](https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts) to make a theme installer and updater. Currently only themes by [Jetup](https://github.com/Jetup13) are included.  
Thanks to **choo t** for the theme update script used to install/update the supported themes  

## Installation
Place *AnberThemes.sh* and *AnberThemes* folder in `/roms/tools` and add the following line to `/etc/fstab` then reboot  
```/roms/tools /opt/system/Tools        none    bind```
